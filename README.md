# TuuVeiTwo
TuuVeiTwo is a custom mechanical split keyboard with VIAl support and a direct follow-up to the TuuVeiSplit keyboard.

Design by Santeri Jauhiainen (aka santeridahlia/SanteRaptor) with help from friends and Finnish Mechanical Keyboard Community.

What is it?
- Split ISO TKL with some copied over keys and a rotary encoder for improved gaming and user experience in the split keyboard formfactor
- Powered by 2 Pro Micro controllers connected by a TRRS cable
- Has Vial support
- Supports MX 3 and 5 pin switches

How do I make one?
- There are full Gerbers and Kicad files included in this repo ready to be manufactured under the tuuveitwoproduction file structure.
- Uses 2 arduino pro micros (or alternatives), 2 trough-hole TRRS ports and a TRRS cable for connecting the sides, trough-hole or SMD 1n4148 diodes, 5 2U PCB stabilizers and 2 trough-hole resistors (chose to use 7.4k 1w but less wattage is fine) along with of course the switches of your choice (I do recommend using 5 pin ones), the rotary encoder with a push button and the keycaps for which youll need to remember that there are 2 of the following keys: y, h. b, spacebar (2-2.75u is the recommended size range for spacebars).

Cases?
- Currently working on a more refined case for the boards but for the time being there is a 3D-printable simple slot-in version that isnt perfect but will protect the diodes.

Who made those pretty drawings?
- All Art on the boards was made by my dear friend ZANYFUNK
