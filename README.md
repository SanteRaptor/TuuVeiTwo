Design by Santeri Jauhiainen (aka santeridahlia/SanteRaptor) with help from friends and Finnish Mechanical Keyboard Community.

What is it?
- Split ISO TKL with some copied over keys and a rotary encoder for improved gaming and user experience in the split keyboard formfactor
- Powered by 2 Pro Micro controllers connected by a TRRS cable
- Has Vial support
- Supports MX 3 and 5 pin switches

How do I make one?
- There are full Gerbers and Kicad files included in this repo ready to be manufactured under the tuuveitwoproduction file structure.
- Uses 2 arduino pro micros (or alternatives), 2 trough-hole TRRS ports and a TRRS cable for connecting the sides, trough-hole or SMD 1n4148 diodes, 5 2U PCB stabilizers and 2 trough-hole resistors (chose to use 4.7k 1/4w but less wattage is fine) along with of course the switches of your choice (I do recommend using 5 pin ones), the rotary encoder with a push button and the keycaps for which youll need to remember that there are 2 of the following keys: y, h. b, spacebar (2-2.75u is the recommended size range for spacebars).

Cases?
- Currently there are files available for a really good looking case by Joku1239 for anyone to print in both not tenthered and tenthered versions with magnetically attaching pro micro covers coming soon.
- https://www.printables.com/model/948891-tuuveitwo-case
- Cases use the following
  - 19pcs of M3x3mm Heatset inserts for mounting the pcbs to the cases
  - 19pcs of M3x4mm Hex socket bolts for mounting the pcbs to the cases
  - 8pcs of M5 bolts of desired length for tenting (atleast 20mm)
  - 8pcs of 4.7mm silicone caps for the M5 bolts for tenting
  - 8pcs of M5 Nuts (normal non-locknuts) for tenting
- Soon to be released pro micro covers use the following
  - 4mm x 3mm round magnets for attaching to the case nuts

Plates?
- FR4 plate files for production available (Note! one of the case screw holes under the f10 key is obstructed when using the plate)

Who made those pretty drawings?
- All Art on the boards was made by my dear friend ZANYFUNK
